    1) It will fetch the data values
    2) It will process all the subfunctions in a main function 
    3) the subfunctions will be 
        a) Output HTML : <div> 
                        <h3>${data.Name}</h3>

                        <h4>${data.dedicated}</h4>
                        <img src=${data.imageUrl} alt="${data.attribute}"">
                            <div>

                                    <li>${data.charact}</li> 
                                    <li>${data.charact}</li>
